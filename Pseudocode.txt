1. Find average score:
for(Integer counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter++)
	Prompt user for exam score
	Get exam_score
	Sum = exam_score + Sum
Calculate Avg = Sum / 10
Display Avg


2. Find water run off
Get number of inches_of_rainfall
Get foot_print_width in feet
Get foot_print_length in feet

Calculate foot_print_width in inches 
fpw_inches = foot_print_width * 12
Calculate foot_print_length in inches * 12 inches
fpl_inches = foot_print_length * 12

Calculate roof dimensions in inches
roof_dim = fpl_inches * fpw_inches
Calculate cubic inches of rainfall on roof
roof_rain = roof_dim * inches_of_rainfall

Calculate gallons of rain on roof
rainfall_in_gallons = roof_rain / 231

Display rainfall_in_gallons.
